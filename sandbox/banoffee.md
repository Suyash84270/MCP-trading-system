# Banoffee Pie Recipe

## Ingredients
- 1 can (14 oz) sweetened condensed milk (to make dulce de leche or use ready-made caramel)
- 1 1/2 cups crushed digestive biscuits (or graham crackers)
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted
- 3-4 ripe bananas
- 1 1/2 cups heavy cream
- 2 tablespoons powdered sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- Grated chocolate or cocoa powder (for garnish)

## Instructions

1. **Make the base:** Mix crushed biscuits with melted butter until combined. Press firmly into the base of a 9-inch pie dish. Chill in the refrigerator for about 10 minutes to set.

2. **Make dulce de leche (if needed):** Boil the can of condensed milk in a pot of water, fully submerged, for 2-3 hours to caramelize (or use ready-made caramel). Let it cool.

3. **Assemble the pie:** Spread the cooled caramel (dulce de leche) evenly over the biscuit base.

4. **Add bananas:** Slice the bananas and arrange them on top of the caramel layer.

5. **Whip cream:** Whip the heavy cream with powdered sugar and vanilla until soft peaks form.

6. **Top the pie:** Spread the whipped cream over the bananas.

7. **Garnish:** Sprinkle with grated chocolate or a dusting of cocoa powder.

8. **Chill:** Refrigerate for at least 1 hour before serving to let the flavors meld.

Enjoy your delicious banoffee pie!
